# Windows SMTP Relay Service
Windows SMTP Relay Service with GUI configuration tool.
Micorosft removed the built in SMTP relay server from Windows. This is a replacement. It is actively being developed and I will always try to keep it up to to date with current technologies including the various SMTP smart host authentication standards. Enjoy.
